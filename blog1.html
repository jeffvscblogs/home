            <p>Hello everyone,

Iâ€™m Juman, the lead role behind INKORA, and Iâ€™m thrilled to share my work with you all! Every site has been created and crafted with passion, reflecting not just my vision but also the journeyâ€”failures, lessons, and growth along the way.

What you see now is Version 1, still in its Beta phase, meaning improvements and refinements are ongoing. Stay tuned for more updates, as Iâ€™ll be rolling them out quickly!

Thank you for being a part of this journey! ðŸš€</p>
