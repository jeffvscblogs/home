            <h3>Chapter 1: The Seat That Changed Everything</h3>
            <p>Ahaan walked into the exam hall, already dreading the next three hours. Half-yearly exams were the worst—long, stressful, and boring. He found his roll number on the seating chart outside and sighed.

Row 5, Seat 17.

He shuffled to his spot and paused.

Someone was already sitting there.

She wasn’t from his class. In fact, she wasn’t even from his grade. 11th standard, definitely. She looked different—confident, calm, and completely unaware that she had taken his seat.

Ahaan cleared his throat. "Uh… I think you’re in the wrong place."

She looked up, dark eyes meeting his. "Oh." She glanced at her admit card and then back at him. "Yeah, seems like I am."

Ahaan waited for her to move, but she just… didn’t. Instead, she leaned back, tapping her pen on the desk.

"Looks like they mixed the seating," she said, shrugging. "9th and 11th together. Guess we’re stuck like this."

Ahaan wasn’t sure how he felt about that. A senior? Sitting next to him? During an exam?

"Right. Cool," he muttered, sliding into the chair beside her.

She smirked. "Nervous?"

"Not really."

"Good. Don’t copy my answers."

Ahaan scoffed. "Don’t give me wrong ones then."

She laughed quietly, and that was the first time he noticed—he liked her laugh.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 2: Unexpected Conversations</h3>
            <p>It started with small talk.

"Do you always write this fast?"
"Do you always stare at your paper this long?"
"I’m thinking."
"Or overthinking?"
Then came the post-exam discussions.

"How was it?"
"Brutal. I think I failed."
"Liar."
And before Ahaan even realized it, they kept talking.

Lunch breaks. Hallway encounters. Library visits.

She was always one step ahead, teasing him like a senior but never making him feel like a kid.

And he? He just… liked being around her.

            <h3>Chapter 3: The Slow Realization</h3>
            <p>It wasn’t a crush at first.

But then he started noticing things.

The way she tucked her hair behind her ear when she was focused.
The way she always had a witty comeback, never letting him win too easily.
The way she started waiting near the library, pretending it was a coincidence.
One day, she caught him staring.

"What?" she asked, raising an eyebrow.

Ahaan hesitated. "Nothing. Just… you’re kinda cool, you know?"

She smirked. "Took you this long to figure that out?"

            <h3>Chapter 4: The Goodbye That Wasn’t Supposed to Happen</h3>
            <p>One afternoon, after school, she leaned against the wall, looking at her phone.

Ahaan could tell something was off.

"You okay?" he asked.

She exhaled. "I’m leaving after this term."

His stomach dropped. "Leaving?"

"Yeah. Back to my hometown. School’s over for me soon."

He forced a laugh. "So, I won’t have you correcting my test answers anymore?"

She smiled faintly. "Guess not."

Ahaan wanted to say something—anything. But what was there to say?

She was leaving. And he was staying.

"Well," he said finally, "guess we’ll just… see what happens."

She looked at him for a long time. "Yeah. Maybe nothing. Maybe everything."

And just like that, she walked away.

Leaving behind a story unfinished.

            <h3>Epilogue: The Longest Chapter</h3>
            <p>Days turned into weeks. Ahaan kept checking his phone. Kept waiting for a message that never came.

Until one night—

Ira: You ever think about how some stories don’t end, they just take longer to be told?

His heart raced.

Ahaan: Yeah. Like what?
Ira: Like this one.

And just like that, the slow burn continued.

Because some stories don’t need an ending. They just need time. :heart:</p>
